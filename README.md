# Lacinia - Nubank fork

This repository was forked from https://github.com/walmartlabs/lacinia to fix a [specific issue](https://github.com/walmartlabs/lacinia/pull/309), but it is now unmaintained.

The issue was solved upstream on version 0.36.0, so the upstream dependency should be used instead (`com.walmartlabs/lacinia`).
